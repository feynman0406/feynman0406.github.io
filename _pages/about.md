## Biography

I am a first-year PhD student in Mathematics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk), supervised by Professor [Kelly Zhang](https://kellywzhang.github.io) (Co-supervised by Prof. Andrew Duncan). Before joining Imperial, I earned an MSc in Applied Statistics from the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) in 2024 and a BSc in Mathematics from [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.math.nthu.edu.tw/index.php) in 2023.

I was fortunate to serve as a research assistant with **Dr. Ming-Chung Chang** at the [Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica](https://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/eng/) during July–August 2023 and January–August 2025, and as a visiting scholar from May–August 2024.

For more details about my academic background and experience, please refer to my CV.

# Academic Advisors
- I am extremely fortunate to have been advised by [Dr. Ming-Chung Chang](https://sites.google.com/view/mcchang/), an Associate Research Fellow at the Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, during my senior year as a Mathematics student. He has guided my journey into the field of statistics from then until now.
- During my master's studies, I am very pleased to be advised by [Prof. Raed Al Kontar](https://alkontar.engin.umich.edu/), an Associate professor at the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We collaboratively developed two papers on sequential decision-making, which sparked my interest in this field.
