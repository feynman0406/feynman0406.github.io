## Biography

I am seeking a PhD research position in applied mathematics, scientific computing, or computational physics. I recently completed an M.S. in Scientific Computing and Modeling at  [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/)
 (2024) and a visiting M.S. year at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/)
 (2025). I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from [National Central University](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/tw/index.php)
 in 2022.

My recent work spans numerical wave hydrodynamics and 3D geometry processing. At the University of Oslo’s Wave Hydrodynamic Lab, I simulated solitary-wave–driven boulder transport using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). At NTHU, my master’s thesis proposed an optimized ICP-based registration method with region-aware down-sampling to improve point-cloud alignment. Earlier projects include machine-learning–based galaxy classification for dark-matter studies, quantum circuit optimization, and LiDAR robot navigation with reinforcement learning.

I have also interned at Jin Shin Engineering Consultants on point-cloud compression, feature extraction, and Point Transformer–based segmentation for BIM workflows, as well as at [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/options.html), where I streamlined data systems and built automation tools.

For more details about my academic background and experience, please refer to my CV.


# Research Interest
My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **scientific computing**, with an emphasis on cross-disciplinary integration. I work on point-cloud registration and BIM-oriented segmentation, connect real-world sensing and geometry with SPH simulation, and develop astronomy ML pipelines for data-driven analysis.
